# BrightSign-File-Converter
A simple python tool to convert files organized by a BrightSign system to human-readable files


As BrightSign's documentation says.
>With BrightAuthor 2.2, files published for Simple File Networking updates now reside in the Pool folder.
These files are named using their hash key values, so they have no extensions.

These files are in a Pool folder, and then distributed in a bunch of other files.

An XML file is also created, to list each file whith its details.

thanks to this file I was able to get all the files and rename them, while putting them back to the right folder.


I think nobody is ever gonna use this, but I hope it will be helpful to somebody one day...
